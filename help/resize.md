Originated from [this](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/issues/1807?notification_referrer_id=MDE4Ok5vdGlmaWNhdGlvblRocmVhZDEwNDYwNTg1MTI6NTk1Mjg1MTg%3D) GitHub Issue.  


**Still under development**  

| Keybinds    | Actions              |
|------------ | ---------------------|
| SHIFT+ALT+A | Resize to the left   |
| SHIFT+ALT+D | Resize to the right  |
| SHIFT+ALT+W | Resize to the top    |
| SHIFT+ALT+S | Resize to the bottom |


### Known issues:  
- When fully resizing to the left micro crashes with a `makeslice: cap out of range` error but it also crashes when resizing with mouse pointer    
- When fully resizing to the top it kind of goes out of the micro border
- Doesn't really work with vsplit and hsplit in one window
